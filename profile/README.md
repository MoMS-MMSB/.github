# Welcome
This is the github page of the MoMS group. Modeling bioMolecular Systems (MoMS) is a research group at CNRS led by Luca Monticelli, with Cecil Hilpert as a main software engineer. We study the structure, dynamics, and interactions of biological macromolecules using bioinformatics and molecular simulations. We also develop our own tools, both in the area of bioinformatics and in molecular simulations. We share publicly most of our software tools via this GitHub page. Our ultimate goal is to better understand of the links between structure, interactions and, ultimately, biological functions at the molecular level.

Our main activities focus on biomembranes: structure, dynamics, and interactions. Biological membranes envelop and compartmentalize all living cells. Biomembranes are extremely dynamic entities at all levels â€“ in fact the vast majority of them is liquid, in physiologically relevant states, which makes it very challenging to obtain structural information at high resolution with experimental techniques. We use molecular simulations at multiple levels, from quantum mechanics to all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, to gain insight into membrane structure, dynamics, interactions, and transformations.
